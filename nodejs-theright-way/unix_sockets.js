/* A UNIX socket is an inter-process communication
 * mechanism that allows bidirectional data exchange
 * between processes running on the same machine.
 * IP sockets (especially TCP/IP sockets) are a mechanism
 * allowing communication between processes over the network.
 * In some cases, you can use TCP/IP sockets to talk with
 * processes running on the same computer (by using the loopback interface).
 * UNIX domain sockets know that theyâ€™re executing on the same system,
 * so they can avoid some checks and operations (like routing);
 * which makes them faster and lighter than IP sockets.
 * So if you plan to communicate with processes on the same host,
 * this is a better option than IP sockets.
